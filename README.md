# MEEN 575 Project -- Topology Optimizer

Hey Guys! This is the repository for our optimization project. 

To make your own version of the repository, use the following command

`git checkout -b THE-NAME-OF-MY-NEW-BRANCH`

To save a change to a version of the code use these commands:

```
git add ./
git commit -m "A COMMENT ABOUT MY CHANGE"
git push origin THE-BRANCH-IM-CHANGING
```


I've made a couple of folders:

- `/src` is for the actual optimizer code. This is our final deliverable
- `/include` is for any data files that the optimizer will use in the final project
- `/topology_resources` is for you to throw any GIS data you find
- `/sample_algorithms` is for prototypes and sample code

Have at it!
